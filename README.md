# 📘 Day 18: Queues and Stacks | HackerRank 30 Days of Code

This repository contains the Python solution for Day 18 of the HackerRank 30 Days of Code challenge, focused on the concept of using **Stacks** and **Queues** to solve a palindrome validation problem.

## 🚀 Challenge Summary

You are required to write a class that:

- Pushes characters onto a **stack**
  
- Enqueues characters into a **queue**
  
- Pops characters from the **stack**
  
- Dequeues characters from the **queue**

- Compares popped and dequeued characters to determine if a string is a **palindrome**

## 📝 Problem Statement

Complete a class with the following methods:

- `pushCharacter(char)`: Push a character onto a stack
  
- `enqueueCharacter(char)`: Enqueue a character into a queue
  
- `popCharacter()`: Pop and return the top character of the stack
  
- `dequeueCharacter()`: Dequeue and return the first character from the queue  

Then compare characters from both structures. 

If all comparisons match, the word is a **palindrome**.

## ✅ Constraints

- `s` is composed only of lowercase English letters

## 🔢 Sample Input

        racecar

## ✅ Sample Output

        The word, racecar, is a palindrome.

## 💡 Explanation

- All characters from the string are pushed to a stack and enqueued in a queue.
  
- Characters are popped from the stack (LIFO) and dequeued from the queue (FIFO).
  
- They are compared one by one.
  
- Since all character pairs match, the word is confirmed to be a palindrome.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Stack and Queue Data Structures
  
- FIFO vs LIFO
  
- Class Design and Encapsulation
  
- Palindrome Checking
  
- Input Traversal and Comparison Logic

## 🛠 How to Run

Option 1: With input file

Create a file named `input.txt` with the word you want to test and run:

        python3 queues_and_stacks.py < input.txt

Option 2: Manual input

Just run:

        python3 queues_and_stacks.py
